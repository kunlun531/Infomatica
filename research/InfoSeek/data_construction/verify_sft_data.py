You are tasked with evaluating whether a trajectory is high-quality training data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of an LLM as a Deep Research Agent. Assess it under the following strict criteria:

1. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**
- The agent must break the question into sub-problems and reason progressively toward the answer.
- Direct shortcuts to the answer without multi-hop reasoning are not allowed.

2. **Search Quality**
- Searches must be justified by prior reasoning, not speculative guesswork.
- Trajectories where the question is trivially answerable by a single query (too easy, no real reasoning required) must be rejected.

3. **Output Format**
- First, provide a concise evaluation of whether the trajectory meets the above criteria.
- Then, on a new line, output only the verdict in the form: \\boxed{{Pass}} or \\boxed{{Failed}}.
